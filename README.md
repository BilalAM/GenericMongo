# GenericMongo
A Generic DAO for Mongo using MongoDB API Java

No external library used for mapping EXCEPT google.gson, all mapping is done by owners own logics and implimentations

**Uses google gson library and mongo Json library for serializing and deserializing purposes**

**DAO** --> Abstract And Concrete implimentations of data access classes ( Standard generic Dao pattern)

**MODLES** --> POJO classes

**SCAFFOLDER** --> Generates the concrete model dao classes instead of writing redundant classes ( PLEASE SEE Program.java TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT ALL WORKS
